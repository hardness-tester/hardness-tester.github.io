## 6th Learning Log

I know it's been a while since I posted a learning log from the course I'm taking online. It's just that the past subtopics in the first course didn't have learning logs, mostly quizzes. But here's a new learning log from the first course of the Google Data Analytics courses called Course 1: Foundations: Data, Data Everywhere. I hope the knowledge sticks with me.

There's a sentence from the learning log that resonated with me the most because often, I would always go for positive results when analyzing data or just about anything, but then the learning log reminded me the below statement:

> ...negative results count just as much as positive results in data analysis.
