## 2nd Learning Log

2nd Learning Log from this Google Data Analytics Course that I'm taking. My reflections are on the document found in the link below. 

[Learning Log: Consider how data analysts approach tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TEOtuD0xxiboii2sIGrjZHM-E7pqzhNLadNB-RrX6sk/edit?usp=sharing)

I've been having a hard time getting good quality sleep lately so my reflections are all over the place. One of these days I would take this more seriously as I really really want to transition to Data Science and Cloud Computing hopefully.
