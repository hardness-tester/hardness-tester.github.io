## 5th Learning Log

Just keeping my passion for learning alive and well! Here's another learning log that I have completed from Course 1 of the Google Data Analytics Course in Coursera. I had fun doing this because I get to create a table in Google Docs which I don't commonly use in my everyday tasks. I would usually use Microsoft Word. Not surprisingly, both word processors have almost the same functions so it wasn't difficult for me to adjust. Hopefully when I get to update my CV or resume, I can finally list Google Docs as one of my technical procifencies. I might even write my resume on Google Docs for a change. :)
