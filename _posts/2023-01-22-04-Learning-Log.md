## 4th Learning Log

This is a self assessment on my analytical skills. Lacking the self-confidence, I can't really see myself possessing the strengths of a great data analyst. So you'll see in my learning log that the only strength I consider myself having is my curiousity. Although I must admit, I don't consider myself curious enough to the point that I will do whatever it takes to find the answers to my curious questions. Regardless, I am still very much willing to improve on my skills just so I can be more proud of myself. I'm doing this for myself. So again, wish me luck~
