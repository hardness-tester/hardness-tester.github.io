## A Spreadsheet Activity

Just here to share some of the links to the spreadsheets I made throughout week 3 of the 2nd course of the Google Data Analytics certificate. It's honestly been a struggle for me to find the time to do these activities and study but I'm powering through it. I really want to finish this and become a data analyst.

[Bakery Sales March 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRvQjVhqBgSBHZ1gSzWYQVlQoTs3aGiObshXU-bNEGQ/edit?usp=sharing "This is a data base of bakery sales in March 2023")

I will share another link once I'm finished polishing it shortly.
